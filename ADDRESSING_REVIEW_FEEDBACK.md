# Addressing Review Feedback for PR #911

## Issues Identified

1. **Indentation in `.github/workflows/test-k8s.yml`**
   - Status: âœ… Fixed in commit 7329c40e
   - Original indentation has been restored

2. **Mixing unrelated changes**
   - Skip logic changes vs. Parallel execution improvements
   - These should be separated into different PRs

## Proposed Solution

### Option 1: Split the current PR
1. Create a new branch for just the skip logic changes
2. Create a new branch for just the parallel execution improvements
3. Submit separate PRs for each

### Option 2: Keep current PR focused on one thing
1. Keep only the skip logic changes in the current PR
2. Create a new PR for the parallel execution improvements

### Option 3: Document and explain the separation in the current PR
1. Clearly document which changes belong to which concern
2. Commit separately and explain in commit messages
3. Future PRs will follow a more focused approach

## Next Steps

Based on reviewer preference, we can implement any of the above options.
