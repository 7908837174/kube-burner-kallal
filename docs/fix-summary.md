# Summary of Fix Implementation for Issue #862

## The Issue
When applying templates with variables in the `kind` field (e.g., `TestCRD{{.Iteration}}`), kube-burner was failing because templating wasn't applied properly before identifying the resource type.

## The Solution
Our implementation successfully addresses this issue by:

1. **Pre-rendering templates before identifying resource types**:
   ```go
   // Create a sample rendering of the template to determine correct GVK
   templateData := map[string]any{
       jobName:      ex.Name,
       jobIteration: 1,
       jobUUID:      ex.uuid,
       jobRunId:     ex.runid,
       replica:      1,
   }
   maps.Copy(templateData, o.InputVars)
   
   // Render the template with sample data to get proper Kind
   renderedTemplate, err := util.RenderTemplate(objectSpec, templateData, templateOption, ex.functionTemplates)
   
   // Deserialize rendered YAML with templated kind properly resolved
   uns := &unstructured.Unstructured{}
   _, gvk := yamlToUnstructured(o.ObjectTemplate, renderedTemplate, uns)
   ```

2. **Detecting and processing CRDs first**:
   ```go
   // Split objects into CRDs and non-CRDs for ordered processing
   var crds []*object
   var nonCRDs []*object
   
   // First pass: separate CRDs from non-CRDs
   for objectIndex, obj := range ex.objects {
       // [...set labels...]
       
       // Categorize objects by type
       if obj.isCRD {
           crds = append(crds, obj)
       } else {
           nonCRDs = append(nonCRDs, obj)
       }
   }
   
   // Process CRDs first
   for _, obj := range crds {
       // [...create CRDs...]
   }
   
   // Wait for CRDs to be completely created before creating CRs
   if len(crds) > 0 {
       log.Debug("Waiting for CRDs to be established before creating Custom Resources")
       wg.Wait()
       time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
   }
   
   // Then process non-CRDs
   for _, obj := range nonCRDs {
       // [...create CRs...]
   }
   ```

3. **Waiting for CRDs to be established**:
   ```go
   // If this is a CRD, wait for it to be established
   if isCRD {
       crdName := uns.GetName()
       log.Debugf("Waiting for CRD %s to be established", crdName)
       
       // Sleep to allow the CRD to be established
       time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
   }
   ```

## Test Results
Our tests confirm that:
1. Templates with variables in the `kind` field render correctly
2. CRDs are created with properly templated kinds
3. CRs referencing those CRDs are created successfully
4. The order of creation is correct (CRDs before CRs)

The fix is complete and ready for integration.
